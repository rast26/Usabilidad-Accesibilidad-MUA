Good morning, I am Raúl Sánchez Tarí, and now we will compare Biological Computing with classical and quantum computing.

First, classical computing is much faster in sequential calculations, whereas biological computing has a high capacity for parallelism.

On the other hand, quantum computing can solve problems of high complexity. However, it requires extreme conditions to operate, while biological computing does not.

Some advantages of biological computing are:

    High capacity for parallelism
    Low energy consumption
    Scalability

And some disadvantages are:

    Poor precision and control
    Inefficiency in sequential tasks
    Difficulty in programming

Thank you very much, that’s all.
