00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.000
Good morning, I’m Raúl Sánchez Tarí, 
and now we’ll compare Biological Computing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.520
with classical and quantum computing.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:16.000
First, classical computing has much faster&nbsp;
sequential calculation speed, while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.200
biological computing has a high&nbsp;
parallel processing capacity.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.680
On the other hand, quantum computing can&nbsp;
solve highly complex problems. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.720
it requires extreme conditions to operate, 
while biological computing does not.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.960
Some advantages of biological computing are:

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.320
High parallel processing capacity&nbsp;

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.640
Low power consumption
Scalability

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.640
And some disadvantages are:

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.360
Poor precision and control
Low efficiency in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.080
sequential tasks
Difficulty in programming

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.920
Thank you very much, that’s all.
